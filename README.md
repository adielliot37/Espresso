  see a very high-quality showing of fewer parts, than an unpolished
  smattering of all the parts. That is to say: **please focus on quality
  over quantity**.

Background
==========

Cryptographic Hash Functions
----------------------------

A *Cryptographic Hash Function* `H` is a special type of function that
takes an arbitrarily long sequence of bytes and returns some fixed-size
"digest" of that sequence.

Cryptographic hash functions have two special properties for our purposes:

- Preimage resistance: given a digest `d`, it's infeasible to calculate a
  string `s` such that `H(s) = d`.
- Collision resistance: it's infeasible to find two strings `s1` and `s2`
  such that `H(s1) == H(s2)`.

Proving that _any_ function has these properties is extremely difficult --
and in some cases, would be a major theoretical breakthrough! So in
practical usage, well-known hash functions that have resisted many attempts
to break them are _assumed_ to be Preimage- and Collision-resistant.

For this problem, we will be using the `SHA-256` hash function, which has a
256-bit digest.

Authenticated Data Structures
-----------------------------

An *Authenticated Data Structure* (ADS) is a data structure with 2 extra
features:

(a) You can calculate a "commitment" of the data structure, which is a
    small, unique cryptographic representation of the data structure.
(b) Queries about the data structure can provide a "proof" of their
    results, which can be checked against the data structure's digest.

Generally, properties of an authenticated data structure rely on
standard cryptographic assumptions, e.g. that no one can invert or
find collisions in a particular cryptographic hash function.

Commitments must uniquely determine the data structure's value -- ie,
if `a.commit() == b.commit()`, then `a == b`.

"Equal" data structures may not always have equal commitments.
Depending on what `a == b` means, there may be two data structures `a`
and `b` where `a == b` but `a.commit() != b.commit()`. For example, an
array can be used to represent a set, but there are many potential
arrays that can represent the same set!

Proofs for queries must be complete and sound. Completeness means that
every valid query result has a valid proof. Soundness means that valid
proofs imply that the query results are correct. More formally, if you
receive a result `r` for a query `q`, and a proof `pf`, and
`check_proof(r,pf,ads.commit())` succeeds, then `ads.run_query(q) == r`.

A popular example of an ADS is the Git version control system. Git's core
data structure is an authenticated file directory -- the "commitment" is
the commit hash, and queries about files can be "proven" by providing the
other data required (eg, other filenames, those file's hashes, parent
commit hashes, etc.) to calculate the commit hash.

Authenticated Key-Value Stores
------------------------------

An authenticated Key-Value Store is an ADS of an "associative array" or
"map". The methods of the data structure are described in
`src/kv_trait.rs`:

    fn new() -> Self;
    fn commit(&self) -> Self::Commitment;
    fn check_proof(key: Self::K, res: Option<Self::V>, pf: &Self::LookupProof,
        comm: &Self::Commitment) -> Option<()>;

    fn insert(self, key: Self::K, value: Self::V) -> Self;
    fn get(&self, key: Self::K) -> (Option<Self::V>,Self::LookupProof);
    fn remove(self, key: Self::K) -> Self;

`insert`, `get`, and `remove` behave like the same methods in
`std::collections::HashMap`, except that `insert` and `remove` return
copies of the ADS rather than taking `&mut self`.

A Motivating Example: A Sorted K/V Store
========================

As a helpful guide, please review the implementation in `src/sorted_kv.rs`.
This is an example of a sorted K/V store whose behavior is intended to mimic
a HashMap. We recognize that candidate exposure to cryptographic concepts
might be limited and, as a result, you may use this to inform your understanding.
Here, we provide a guide for reading through the code, as exhaustively going
over every line might not be the best use of your time.

Conceptual check
------------------------
Reading the contents of `SortedKV::check_proof`, we wish to first describe
of why `SortedKV::check_proof` is correct.

In particular, we want to think about how `check_proof` should be complete
and sound, two important properties of any cryptographic hash function,
specifically, we would like to answer the following:

- Complete (easier): Why can you always generate a proof for `(key,res,ads.commit())`
- that `check_proof` accepts if `ads.get(key) == res`?:
  - The principle of completeness states that, for every valid query result,
    there is a proof which can validate that result. In this case, if
    `(key, res, ads.commit())` is accepted by the prover, then it _must_
    mean that `ads.get(key) == res`. This is due to the underlying hash function,
    `SHA-256`, which is a cryptographic hash function that is collision resistant,
    and has strong preimage resistance. Therefore, the hash function guarantees
    that a valid proof can always be generated for a correct result.

- Sound (trickier): suppose you could compute some `ads: SortedKV`, `key: K`,
 `res: Option<V>`, and `pf: LookupProof` where `ads.get(key).0 != res`
 but `SortedKV::check_proof(key,res,pf,ads.commit()).is_some()`. Why would
 this break the assumption that `SHA-256` is a cryptographic hash function?
  - Suppose we have two different data structures, `ads` and `ads'`, where `ads`
    contains the key `key` with value `res`, and `ads'` does not. If we could find
    a proof pf such that `SortedKV::check_proof(key, res, pf, ads.commit()).is_some()`
    even though `ads.get(key) != res`, it would imply that `ads.commit()`
    (the root hash) is the same for both `ads` and `ads'` despite them containing
    different data. Since the root hash is computed using SHA-256 over the
    entire data structure, having `ads.commit() == ads'.commit()` while `ads != ads'`
    would mean weâ€™ve found a collision in the hash function. This
    contradicts the collision resistance property of SHA-256.
    Therefore, being able to produce such `ads`, `key`, `res`, and `pf` would break the
    assumption that SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function because it would
    demonstrate a hash collision where two different inputs produce the same hash output.

Understanding these properties will help with the task below.

ADS Problem: Implementing a Sparse Merkle Tree
==========================

The Sorted K/V Store is a simple data structure, but it has a major
flaw: updates take linear time, since you have to re-calculate all the
hashes in the list.

A more efficient implementation can be built around a single key
realization: bit-strings can be interpreted as paths down binary
trees! Instead of storing `(K,V)` pairs in sorted order, we can store
them in a particular leaf of a binary tree, with the location being
determined by `H(K)`. If `H` is a 256-bit hash, this binary tree has
height 256, and thus will be _overwhelmingly_ empty.

To make things more concrete, a `Sparse Merkle Tree` built on a
cryptographic hash function `H` with an `N`-bit digest is a binary
tree of height `N` such that:

- Leaf nodes are encoded `(K,V)` pairs, located at the leaf node
  determined by reading the bits of `H(K)` as `0 -> left`,
  `1 -> right`. These bits can be read in any order, but that order
  must be consistent.
    - The digest of a leaf node is a hash `H_leaf(K,V) -> Digest`
      (`H_leaf` is built on `H`)
- Subtrees with no leaf nodes are represented as a special "Empty
  subtree", with a special digest (A common choice is the all-`0`
  digest).
- Branch nodes have left and right subtrees, and the digest of a
  branch node is a hash `H_branch(Digest,Digest) -> Digest` of the
  digests of its child subtrees.

The digest of the whole tree is the digest of the root node (thus,
either the all-`0` digest, or some `H_branch`). Lookup proofs are
built on the concept of "sibling hashes" -- ie, for a node `B =
Branch(l,r)`, the sibling hash of `r` is `l.digest()`, and vice versa.
A lookup proof for `(K,None)` is then a list of sibling hashes
following a prefix of `H(K)` which reaches an empty subtree. A lookup
proof for `(K,Some(V))` is a list of sibling hashes following `H(K)`
which ends in `(K,V)`. If the list of sibling hashes is enough to
calculate the root digest of the overall tree, and thus a proof is
valid if and only if it recalculates the correct root digest.

Guidance For The Road
---------------------
Remember, we want *complete*, well-documented, well-tested code. We'd
most-prefer you have excellent code, but not finish all the tasks, than
sloppy code that does everything. That being said, it is expected that
you will, at a minimum, complete tasks 1 and 2.

Task 1: Conceptual check
------------------------

Briefly describe in `sparse_mt.md` your understanding of why this data
structure would work. Some good things to touch on would be:

- How do you know that each key is in a unique leaf? (Hint: think
  about hash function properties).
- Which hash function assumption does representing the empty subtree
  by the all-`0` digest rely upon?
- Suppose there were two sparse merkle trees which differ in exactly
  one key, but their digests are the same. Why does this break
  collision-resistance?

Task 2: Basic Implementation
----------------------------

In `src/sparse_merkle_tree.rs`:

Create a `SparseMerkleTree` type which has `String` keys and `String`
values. Implement `commit()`, `get()`, `insert()`, and `check_proof()`. Include
some comments justifying why these implementations are correct.

Task 3: Add Testing and Remove Behavior
----------------
Think about how you would implement the remove() function and implement unit/invariant
testing. You can use the provided example as a baseline for how to structure your tests.
Consider performance, in terms of space. We may, depending on time, use
this as a discussion topic during an interview. Bonus points for test content!
